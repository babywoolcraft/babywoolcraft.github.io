Over the last couple of years I have been (naively) using the terminal mainly to navigate directories and to commit changes in version control. Recently, I decided that I should learn more about the command line and shell scripting so I bought the **Linux command line and shell scripting bible**. As I read through this book I'm going to make notes which will be easily accessible on this page.

## Basic bash shell commands

Walk before you can run - first lets get to grips with the basics.

### Some basics

#### Directory structure

A **parent directory** is the directory one level back, i.e. ```parent_dir/current_dir```.

A **sub directory** or **child directory** is a directory located within the current directory, i.e. ```current_dir/sub_directory```.

Specifying destinations (either files or directories) are summarised in the following table.

| Destination | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```.``` | current directory |
| ```destination``` or ```./destination``` | destination located in current directory |
| ```path/to/destination``` | destination located within one or more sub directories |
| ```..``` | parent directory |
| ```../destination```  | destination located in parent directory |
| ```../path/to/destination``` | destination in a sub directory of the parent directory |

#### Identifying via naming convention

SAY ABOUT *, ?, [-XXX]

### Navigating directories

We can change directories using the ```cd``` command syntax. The command takes a single parameter: the **directory** which you wish to navigate to.

```sh
$ cd destination    #see table detailing choices of destination
```

Note that the single dot is usually omitted when using the ```cd``` command for files within the current directory.

If you leave the parameter blank the ```cd``` command will take you back to your home directory.

```sh
$ cd    #go to the home directory
```

It is often useful to see which directory you are currently in. To do this we can use the ```pwd``` command. Simply type this into the terminal (no need for any parameters!).

```sh
$ pwd    #view the present working directory
```

### Listing contents of directories

To list the contents of a directory we use the ```ls``` command. If no parameter is supplied, ```ls``` lists the contents of the current directory.

```sh
$ ls destination_of_directory    #lists all files and directories contained in the destination
```

```sh
$ ls     #lists contents of current directory
```

We can also list all of the files following a naming convention using the following command.

```sh
$ ls naming_convention
```

The ```ls``` command has many options some of which are listed in the table below. To see a full list of options use the ``` $ man ls ``` (for manual) command.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```-a``` | shows all files including hidden files such as dot files (```.a_dotfile```) |
| ```-R``` | recursively lists contents of directory and sub directories |
| ```-F``` | directories end with a backslash ```/``` |
| ```-l``` | a long listing providing more information about the files |

An example of using some options:

```sh
$ ls -a -l destination_of_directory    #list all files in long format in the destination directory
```
